# Quant-Macro
This repository contains my code and presentation slide in Quantitative macroeconomics at UT.

If you find some problems and more efficient way, please let me know.


## How to edit my jupyter notebook.

First, you need to download my code. Push "clone or download" button and then push download ZIP.

[JuliaBox](https://auth.juliacomputing.io/dex/auth?response_type=code&client_id=dev-juliabox&state=6e2d2b150fd1dc5cac1249a8139a5531&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjuliabox.com%2Fauth%2Flogin&nonce=cc0e2b23a35c5a06fb981665a1f2bbba&scope=openid%20email%20profile%20offline_access) is a good way to run my code without installing Julia.
You need to log in this site with your Github or Google or LinkedIn account.(In my opinion, it is a good time to be familiar with git and github.)

After log in julia box, upload AR(1).ipynb to your juliabox environment and you can freely run and change my file. 
If you want to know julia, [Quant Econ](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/), , especially "programming in Julia" is preferable.

mytauchen.jl: tauchen method

myrouwenhorst.jl: rouwenhorst method 

AR(1).ipynb: presentation slide

In the github page, AR(1).ipynb cannot be rendered precisely, so
**please visit [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/tokupooh/Quant-Macro/blob/master/AR%281%29.ipynb?flush_cache=true#/) and see my slide. **

If you do not change my code in the AR(1).ipynb, It is enough to see my slide at nbviewer.
